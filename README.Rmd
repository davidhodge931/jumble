<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The objective of jumble is to provide a discrete colour palette that is colour-blind safe, as well as some other useful colours.

## Installation

You can install the development version of jumble from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("davidhodge931/jumble")
```

## Example

jumble provides a discrete palette that is relatively colourblind safe.

```{r example}
library(jumble)
scales::show_col(jumble)
```

```{r}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(jumble)
```


It also provides some other colours with accessible names.

```{r cars}
scales::show_col(
  c(teal, orange, navy, red, pink, oat, black, grey, beige, slate, blue, ocean)
)
```
